These are 3 things Yahoo Finance will be looking out for. Number one is national security: How will TikTok address privacy and data security concerns as well as how it handles user data, and what would TikTok do if the Chinese government says hand that data over? Number two is TikTok’s growth: TikTok this week revealed its monthly active users in the U.S. hit 150M; that's a jump of 50% in the past 2+ years. Any wide-ranging U.S. ban could potentially hurt the more than 100,000 creators using TikTok for extra income. Number three is influence or interference: 2024 is a presidential election year in the U.S., so expect questions on misinformation, political influence, and even how children are affected by the content.

The tech giant introduced its buy now pay later offering, Apple Pay Later, in March but Siemiatkowski doesn't feel the pressure just yet. He joined Yahoo Finance to discuss the growing buy now pay later space. Siemiatkowski said he loves Apple (AAPL) Pay, but it hasn’t caught up to Klarna yet, “there’s so many limitations that it will take years before this product has any potential significant impact on what we’re doing.” When it comes to other major companies in the space, Siemiatkowski said that in his 18 years in the business Klarna has stayed competitive. “First it was like Paypal (PYPL) is too big and they were going to kill us in the Nordics and they were going to kill us in the German speaking countries, and then they were going to kill us in the UK and here we are now killing them in the U.S.,” he said. Where Siemiatkowski is worried about competition is startups, not tech giants. “It's the startups and the new people coming with new, great ideas moving at super slight speed. Those are the ones you should be worried about as a company,” he said. Watch the full interview with Seana Smith and Dave Briggs here.

Discovery faces challenges with ""a broken film content creation engine"" that's been on a ""cold spell"" for the past five years, says Martin. Apple is a strong distribution platform, and would stand to benefit from buying a ""successful and healthy film studio."" Enter: Disney. If they combined, Apple (AAPL) and Disney (DIS) would stand to benefit from ""a lot of synergies"" between Apple's strong distribution network of iPhones and Disney's powerhouse content, says Martin. But hope is not lost for Warner Bros. Discovery. The company has a ""big library"" of names, with plans to launch another Superman movie to bolster the D.C. Comic brand. Martin says she expects Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to look to Paramount (PARA) as a potential acquisition opportunity, given Paramount's recent sliding stock. Martin says Warner Bros. Discovery is ""just managing the same company"" as Paramount, but better. In her full interview, Martin dives deeper into Warner Bros. Discovery earnings with Rachelle Akuffo.
