""Tesla hasn't really shown us anything like they used to, where they can just drop something and wow everybody and stay years ahead,"" says DeMuro to Yahoo! Finance Live. The competition among automakers for EV buyers has intensified recently, with entries from new companies like Rivian (RIVN) aiming for the pickup and rugged truck market, and industry stalwarts like Ford (F), Volkswagen (VOW3.DE), and General Motors (GM) offering vehicles like the GMC Hummer EV. DeMuro says the competition has eroded Tesla's first-mover advantage, with some of the blame attributed to Tesla's lack of new updates in nearly a decade. DeMuro points to Tesla's pickup as one example. ""The cybertruck, which has been touted and vaunted for years, is late,"" he says. ""Rivian is already out with a pickup, General Motors is out with a pickup, Ford has the lightning."" When Tesla introduced new vehicles, ""It was so far ahead of everybody else that you couldn't catch up to Tesla,"" says DeMuro. ""In the ensuing 10 years, people have caught up to Tesla.""

To find out more, we went to the ground floor of the new tech sector, where technology meets culture, and the South meets the Southwest. Webster’s dictionary defines AI as “the simulation of human behavior in computers”. Sounds harmless right? But with the exploding popularity of generative chat bots like ChatGPT, many people are reexamining where they stand on the technological food chain. Ian Beacraft is one of the leading voices in deep tech and AI. His company, Signal and Cipher, teaches large companies how to adapt to new technology. “Generative ai is here. it's in everyone's palms and it's not going anywhere,” says Ian, telling Yahoo Finance that we’ve only scratched the surface of what AI can do. “We are at the very beginning of one of the biggest revolutions in knowledge work in human history and a lot of people look at this as a large step change in the way that we do our work… what we're doing is we are digitizing skills the same way that we mechanized physical labor in the industrial revolution… we're doing things at a scale, at a volume, and at a breadth that human minds aren't really capable of.” So, will the rise of AI lead to job losses? And if so, why should we embrace this technology? We met with Garry Kasparov, the former chess Grandmaster, famous for his series of chess matches against the 1980’s supercomputer, “Deep Blue”. “Every new technology in the past has threatened jobs, actually destroyed jobs, destroyed industry before creating new opportunities,” Kasparov told us. “AI is not the exception. Machines made us stronger in the past, made us faster in the past… so, many jobs we are doing today, in my view, are like zombie jobs. They're already dead. They just don't know yet.” So far, our experts have not painted a particularly rosy picture for the future of mankind, so we went directly to the source. You know what they say- keep your enemies close. According to ChatGPT, “Artificial intelligence has the potential to greatly impact the future of humanity in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, AI has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, education, and transportation.” That doesn’t sound too bad, but it goes on: “One major concern is that as AI systems become more advanced, they may become difficult to control, potentially leading to unintended consequences or even catastrophic outcomes.” Therein lies the concern, and why many in the tech industry are approaching AI with a good deal of caution. “People are getting freaked out. They’re saying ‘Hey, what is this thing? Can we trust it?’” “I see both sides of the argument. and, you know, in some ways, there is a lot of opportunity, but on the other hand, we also have to be careful, just like with any technology,” says Pulkit Agrawal, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at MIT. Instead of thinking of AI as a replacement for human beings, according to Pulkit, we should think of AI as a tool. Like the invention of the PC, artificial intelligence may actually improve our work and make humans more efficient in performing our day-to-day tasks. “If an AI system can look at CT scans, and make a diagnosis, is it going to replace a doctor or not? I would say no. I think the right way to implement the system is to make the system be an advisor to a doctor, because this AI system has looked at more CT scans than any doctor could have looked in his life,” Pulkit says. While the possibilities for AI may seem limitless, it could be the key to unlocking the potential of the human brain.

Levy told Yahoo Finance that he expects Tesla deliveries in Q1 to exceed the street’s consensus estimates saying, “we are forecasting 425,000 units of volume ahead of consensus 420,000 units.” Tesla has been cutting prices to help boost the demand needed to reach new delivery targets.

Ultimately humans will be the winners and we'll see humans continue to get more creative and more productive…AI can be used in music to enhance production, consumption, many different things. and I think the possibilities are endless,” Fine says. So endless, that in just a few months AI generated artworks have spread across the internet like wildfire and developers made a boatload of money for what seemed like an original idea. “Especially in the art space, we have lawsuits that have been taking place around representation and compensation. Artists are often having their art put into the data set to train those models without any notification and without any compensation, notice, or attribution,” Signal and Cipher CEO, Ian Beacraft told us. “People have put out their life's work onto the internet, and now these models have come along and scrapes the whole internet and said ‘we're just training it on everything.”’ Theft of intellectual property is hardly a modern problem, but leave it to the free market to come up with a modern solution. Image licensing companies like Getty (GETY) and Shutterstock (SSTK) are diving head-first onto the AI wave, using their massive image databases to build AI content generators and sharing the profits with contributing artists. “The way that people tell stories is continuing to evolve. At one point it was images, then it was video,and now it's music. Now it may be generated content,” says Shutterstock Chief Product Officer Meghan Schoen. So what does the future of creativity look like? Schoen says, “the way I describe it is you're sitting in a pitch meeting or trying to bring an idea to life and you may have a vision in your head of astronauts eating breakfast on Mars. In the past, how do you actually describe that to a roomful of creatives? To help them understand and conceptualize what you're talking about? Now, they can just describe that, get a visual, and now they're not starting from a blank piece of paper… and they can build stories on top of that.”",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5db932c61a3b2fbb3bffbae1596107279d9eeff21e50b6ff08a828f532215047

The EV standard bearer is in a phase where ""they need to get growth"" to absorb the fixed costs they've built up, says Phillippe Houchois, Jefferies Managing Director, speaking with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman on Yahoo Finance Live. Houchois downgraded its shares to Hold from Buy, and dropped the price target to $185 from $230. Tesla shares slid sharply after first quarter results revealed those tighter margins; the selloff pushing Elon Musk's business below the half-trillion dollar mark. On the earnings call, its billionaire CEO stood his ground, saying the move toward higher volume ""is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin."" Even with the selloff sparked by first quarter earnings, Tesla is still up year-to-date while retaining some of the healthiest margins in the industry. Tesla's big push toward cutting prices is an evolution for the brand. Previously they were touted as expensive, ""premium cars"" Houchois says. Now the electric vehicle maker is ""improving affordability"" across the industry, but those big slashes cut into margins. Expanding volume will give Tesla ""an edge to reduce variable costs,"" Houchois says. But the automaker will need to ""grow 30% to actually absorb"" fixed costs. ""We just don't know exactly when the trough will be,"" Houchois says, adding ""it's an ongoing process."" In his full interview, Phillippe Houchois also spoke with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman about Tesla's (TSLA) need to expand EV lineups.

CFO John Lawler told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith the company is focused on profitability for its electric offerings, saying ""we are not going to sacrifice profitability just for share in volume"". The comments allude to Tesla's pricing strategy; Elon Musk told investors last month that ""pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice"" after lower prices narrowed margins for the automaker. Despite the comments, Ford unveiled cuts of it own. It's dropping the cost of its Mustang Mach-E by up to $4,000. It also laid out its first quarter earnings by division for the first time. Although the automaker beat overall expectations with strong revenue growth, its EV division revealed a pre-tax loss of $722 million. Ford expects it to turn operating margins positive by 2026. Ford is taking a ""balanced approach"" to EV pricing, Lawler says, making sure any adjustments serve the company well in the long run. When cutting costs, Ford will be ""thoughtful"" to keep that balance. Lawler added that Ford is at an advantage as one of the first movers in the EV space, which will help establish brand loyalty among new EV customers. In his full interview, Lawler dives deeper into Ford's strong first quarter with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman.
