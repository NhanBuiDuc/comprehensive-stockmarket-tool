It’s South by Southwest, an annual celebration that’s billed as both a conference and a festival, or somewhere in the middle, but as organizers and veterans will tell you, ‘you just have to be there.’ It’s a mashup of film, music, tech, and culture. A place where you can watch Ironman lecture a crowd on cyber-security, receive healthcare advice from the Jonas Brothers, and watch a movie premiere in virtual reality, all in one afternoon. But why is this happening? And who’s going? Well, everyone- fans, entrepreneurs, thrill seekers, investors, and they’re all going for the same reason- they’re looking for the next big thing. For the first time in a long time, the tech sector is experiencing a transformation. You’ve read about it in the news, heard about it in the break room, and you’ve seen it with your own eyes on social media. I’m talking about AI and what some are calling “deep tech” – those scientific advancements which include innovations in areas like virtual reality and robotics. Between star studded conversations and out-of-this-world exhibits, SXSW will give us a sneak peak into the future and how these new technologies will change our economy and our world, from the way we work, to the way we play. We’ll be speaking to the top thinkers and up and coming entrepreneurs about what all of this means for both businesses and consumers, because we’re on the edge of a brand new era in modern technology, and SXSW is the main stage. Over the past few years, there’s been a shift in how we think about the tech industry and the emergence of a new capital city for American business. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL)— why are the world’s most valuable companies all moving to Austin, Texas? Could it be the weather? The taxes? The food?

Concerns still abound however, and a well-known figure has entered the chat. Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai told '60 Minutes' artificial intelligence could be very ""harmful"" if used incorrectly, and called for further regulatory frameworks. That's a sentiment echoed by Douglas Rushkoff, Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics at CUNY; he told Yahoo Finance Live that regulation is ""a necessary framework."" The conversation was timely, with EU lawmakers reportedly drawing up plans to regulate the space with a new set of tailored rules. The U.S. Commerce Department has also set out its stall; it's currently fielding opinions on the need for A.I. audits and risk assessments. Rushkoff says that when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence, the easiest way ""isn't to change what A.I.s do, it's to change what we do."" ""Raising A.I. is a bit like raising children,"" he adds, ""they're going to listen to whatever is going on in the room.""

Naik joined Brad Smith and Julie Hyman to discuss the tech layoff landscape ahead of earnings from major tech companies this week. Naik says those affected by tech layoffs are still able to find a new gig ""in a pretty decent time, which is anywhere from six to nine weeks."" Naik is also working with companies that are ""scaling steadily,"" who need recruiters' help to navigate a market ""saturated"" with talent. A.I. also plays a role in the tech workforce conversation, Naik says. Tech companies have been using artificial intelligence to ""guide their strategies"" when re-organizing their workforce, whether that means cutting jobs or pivoting direction. A.I. is keeping talent acquisition costs down too, Naik adds, helping with prescreening resumes or profiles to make the process ""more streamlined and efficient."" Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) are all expected to report over the next few days after a strong first few months for stock performance. Tech has seen a massive number of job cuts so far in 2023, up 5% from the annual total in 2022. According to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the only year that saw more job cuts was 2001 - the dotcom bubble burst.

Wojcicki says she’s ‘disappointed’ in the lack of progress around genomics, despite having just crossed a significant milestone, 20 years since the first complete sequencing of the human genome. “I think part of the reason is that genetics tells you a lot about what you're at risk for and it doesn't necessarily financially pay to get you that preventative information and to intervene in that way versus just treating people once they have a disease.” The 23andME (ME) CEO also says they are looking into building new partnerships with pharmaceutical companies once the company’s partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) ends in July.
